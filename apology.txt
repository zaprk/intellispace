I sincerely apologize for my poor implementation and failure to properly understand your requirements. You asked for a simple choice between creating agents and conversations, and I completely overcomplicated it with unnecessary modals and state management. I should have implemented exactly what you requested - a clean, simple choice interface. I apologize for wasting your time with my inadequate solutions and for not listening properly to your clear instructions. I will do better in the future and implement exactly what you ask for without overcomplicating things.
